  <strong>Distributed Control Plane for Infrastructure & Applications</strong><br/>
  <sub>Event-driven • Declarative • Cloud-native</sub>
</p>

---

FluxForge is an opinionated, event-driven control plane for operating infrastructure and applications across distributed environments.

It unifies remote execution, desired-state management, and automation workflows into a single, extensible system.

Think of FluxForge as:

- The execution power of Salt  
- The control-loop mindset of Kubernetes  
- The flexibility of event-driven automation  

Unified into a simpler, API-first control plane.

## Why FluxForge

Modern infrastructure is fragmented.

Teams operate across:
- Cloud and on-prem environments
- Containers, virtual machines, and bare metal
- Multiple automation and orchestration tools

Most existing solutions solve only part of the problem:
- **Configuration tools** enforce state but lack real-time orchestration
- **Orchestrators** manage workloads but not operational workflows
- **Automation tools** execute tasks but lack a global control plane

FluxForge exists to unify these concerns.

It provides a single system that:
- Maintains **desired state**
- Reacts to **events**
- Executes **distributed actions**
- Continuously observes **actual state**
